# Lernorte für MorGEN Wordpress plugin

This is a WordPress plugin for the Lernorte für MorGEN website.

Pretty specific stuff, but if you want to get some inspiration or get in contact or feedback, feel free!

Other parts are covered by the [Child-Theme](https://github.com/gen-germany/lernorte-fuer-morgen-childtheme).

## Installation

There is not much sense in installing this for a page different then "lernorte für morgen" - if you are inclined to do that its a good idea to get in contact with us first.

  * Install [github-updater](https://github.com/afragen/github-updater)
  * Use [github-updater](https://github.com/afragen/github-updater) and provide `https://github.com/gen-germany/lernorte-fuer-morgen-plugin` as the URL.

## Implemented Features

  * Make nested shortcodes work (although this might be removed once features implemented within this plugin TODO) - done in `lernorte-fuer-morgen.php` .
